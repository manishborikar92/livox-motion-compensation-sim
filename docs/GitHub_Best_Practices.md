### 📂 Repository Structure & Essential Files

A well-organized repository helps users and contributors navigate your project. Create the following files and directories in your project's root.

* **`README.md`**: The most important file. It should include a clear project description, installation and usage instructions, example images or GIFs, and contribution credits.
* **`LICENSE`**: An essential legal document. Choose an open-source license like **MIT** or **Apache 2.0** to inform others of their usage rights.
* **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to exclude from version control. Be sure to ignore virtual environments, large output files (e.g., `lidar_simulation_output/`), and system-specific temporary files.
* **`requirements.txt`**: A plain text file listing all Python package dependencies required to run the project (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
* **Directories**:
    * **`docs/`**: For detailed documentation, tutorials, and guides that don't fit in the main README.
    * **`examples/`**: To provide example configuration files, sample data (like point clouds), and expected results.
    * **`configs/`**: For storing predefined simulation configurations (e.g., urban, highway, indoor).

### ⚙️ Repository Settings & Configuration

Configure your repository's settings on GitHub to enable community features and improve discoverability.

* **Description**: Write a concise, one-sentence tagline that clearly explains the project's purpose. For example:
    > *A LiDAR motion compensation simulator for the Livox Mid-70 with environment generation and LVX export.*
* **Topics**: Add relevant keywords to make your repository discoverable. Examples: `lidar`, `livox`, `motion-compensation`, `simulation`, `point-cloud`, `sensor-fusion`.
* **Enable Issues**: Activate the **Issues** tab to allow users to report bugs, track tasks, and suggest enhancements.
* **Enable Discussions**: Activate the **Discussions** tab to create a forum for Q&A, feature requests, and general announcements.
* **Enable GitHub Pages**: Host your documentation website directly from your repository, typically by serving the contents of the `/docs` folder.

### 📊 Advanced GitHub Features

Leverage powerful GitHub features to automate processes and showcase project quality.

* **Badges**: Add status badges from a service like [shields.io](https://shields.io/) to the top of your `README.md`. Common badges include:
    * Build Status (from GitHub Actions)
    * License
    * Python Version
    * Package Downloads
* **Releases**: Use **GitHub Releases** to create tagged, versioned packages of your software. This provides stable checkpoints for users to download and use.

### 📸 Visuals & Presentation

Visual aids make your repository significantly more engaging and easier to understand.

* **Screenshots**: Include images that show key results, such as trajectory plots or **before-and-after comparisons** of motion-compensated point clouds.
* **GIFs**: Create short, animated GIFs to demonstrate the project in action, such as showing the motion compensation process over time. 
* **Diagrams**: Add diagrams to illustrate the project's architecture, data flow, or core workflow.
